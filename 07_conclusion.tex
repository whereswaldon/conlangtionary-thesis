\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

Conlangtionary's goal was to explore how modern web technologies could meet the needs of conlangers and field linguists across the world. In this respect, the project succeeded. The site demonstrates that such a platform can be constructed on the web. A class of Appalachian State University Honors Students used Conlangtionary to build a language as part of a class. While they consistently commented upon the clunkiness of the site's user interface, they did create the Keebouuzhodee language with hundreds of defined words using the site.

As Chapter \ref{chap:future} demonstrates, there is much more work that can be done with online platforms for spoken language development. Conlangtionary is only a starting point for future web developers to build from.
