\begin{abstract}
This project documents a prototype system that represents spoken languages of arbitrary structure or complexity for use by field linguists and conlangers. The prototype is capable of representing complex languages, but serves only as a foundation for future work, as it lacks many generative features that would make it appealing to its target audience.
